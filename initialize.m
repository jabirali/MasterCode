% This script initalizes the Matlab for using the 'bvp6c' differential 
% equation solver and the Superconductor/Ferromagnet material classes,
% by adding the relevant subdirectories to path. This should be run
% automatically by all the simulation scripts in this folder; but
% it should also be run manually if you want to work interactively
% with the 'Superconductor' and 'Ferromagnet' classes.
